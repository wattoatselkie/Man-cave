 This is basic information reguarding programming learning for myself.
 
 I have been programming in SAS since 1980 using it for analysis and data manipulation basically in the University wherein I worked before retirement. 
 At one time, back in the '80s, I taught SAS for SAS: being one of two people at that time, ratified by SAS to teach for them in Melbourne, Victoria Australia.
 
 My current aim is to update my skills for my own personal use transitioning from transactional programming to, perhaps, object programming, [as much as I feel that it has massive limitations in certain scenarios] and have a brief look at AI.
 
 My "fun" programming in SAS was to have programs that were self modifying. Back in the eighties I wrote a special self sizing program comprising about 270 lines of sas code that produced approximately 50,000 lines of code when running. I say approximately, as I am estimating from the pages of output: This was back in mainframe days and those lines of code produced about 1200, 66 line pages of output. Whilst the program was hedged with processing limits I could not tell until it ran just how many lines of code it would produce nor how long processing would take.  
 
 Good fun or what!?!?!?!
