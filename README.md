 This is basic information reguarding programming learning for myself.
 
 I have been programming in SAS since 1980 using it for analysis and data manipulation basically in the University wherein I worked before retirement. 
 At one time, back in the '80s, I taught SAS for SAS: being one of two people at that time, ratified by SAS to teach for them in Melbourne, Victoria Australia.
